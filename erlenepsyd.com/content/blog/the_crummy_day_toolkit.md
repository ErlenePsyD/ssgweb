Summary: We all face crummy days, but we can deal with them effectively by creating a personal "Crummy Day Toolkit." This involves recognizing your discomfort, finding calming behaviors that aren't harmful, and reflecting on your reactions. Tactics such as engaging in small, manageable tasks, taking a nature walk, indulging in sensory pleasures, dancing, self-care routines, selective socialization, and leisure reading can significantly transform your day.

## What to Do on a Crummy Day

We all know what a crummy day is. It typically begins soon after getting out of bed, often with a vivid recollection of a burdensome task ahead. It might also be due to dreary weather, an annoyance with someone at home, or just not feeling well. And that's all before facing the morning's collection of emails and texts.

I've learned the importance of being prepared to cope with the challenges of a crummy day. Today, I suggest that each of us creates a "Crummy Day Toolkit."

## Understanding the "Crummy" Feeling

Firstly, let's understand what "crummy" is and what it is not. Feeling crummy is not a response to a major life event, challenge, or trauma. That would be considered a major feeling, not "crummy."

Crummy describes a sensation of being slightly off your game in a negative direction. It is a disconcerting feeling of not being entirely in sync. Your mood might be "down," but not in the deep blue range. Energy levels are low, movements may be a bit slower than usual, there might be a minor brain fog and perhaps some audible sighing. If a reset button existed, it would be highly welcome when you start the day feeling crummy.

## Self-Reflection Activity

>"Reflecting on our reactions and responses is a critical first step in building our toolkit."

Consider how you typically react and respond to feeling "crummy." To help us in developing the Toolkit, it's necessary to analyze our usual reactions and responses to a crummy day. Ask yourself, do you tend to wallow in it or work through it?

Reactivity refers to automatic, impulsive thoughts and behaviors that accompany the crummy feeling. Responses are what we do to reduce the discomfort, such as engaging in soothing behavior. Regrettably, some "soothers" can be harmful in the long run or even in the short run.

What's in your personal set of "soothers"? In mine, for example, I have:

* Food: something sweet, like a cookie, pastry, or chocolate
* Clothes: comfy sweatpants, sweatshirt, and a cozy cashmere shawl that serves as my Linus blanket
* Coffee: beans measured and brewed meticulously while I wait in a foggy state until it's ready to be poured into my special mug

## Looking Back to Learn

>"Don't rule out negative experiences from being positive learning opportunities."

The good news is that crummy days, even a short run of them, end. And when they do, it's an ideal time to reflect and learn from our experiences. Ask yourself the following:

* How did I recognize this crummy day? Did it start from the inside (something I thought about), or was it triggered by an external event?
* How did labeling it a "crummy day" make me feel? For example, did I feel sad, angry, fatigued, bored?
* What did I think (React)? What did I do (Response)? What effect did these reactions and responses have on the "crumminess?"

## Strategies for a Crummy Day

### Boosting Productivity

For me, after reaching for a soother or two, simply getting something done, or at least started, tends to be really helpful. It could be a task I've been procrastinating, something not too big so it's doable, and allows me to pat myself on the back in no time.

### Embracing the Physical

Also, taking a walk in nature, just getting out of the house or office, is beneficial. This involves consciously observing your surroundings while walking. It's helpful to focus on something pleasant and interesting (or at least neutral) rather than ruminating on what contributed to the crummy day.

### Engaging the Senses

* **Water:** A warm bath or a cool shower can effectively alleviate crumminess.
* **Scent:** Light your favorite candle or dab on a pleasant fragrance.
* **Music:** Make a playlist for your crummy day toolkit. Avoid songs that induce tears, and keep the volume up for a real immersion!
* **Movement:** Dance to the music. Even a few minutes of dancing works wonders.

### Practicing Self-care

Have you ever tried putting on makeup when you just feel crummy? I find that when I see myself looking "blah," it reinforces the crummy feeling. A little lip gloss, a touch-up to my hair, or even putting on earrings helps. Also, switching from slippers to actual shoes can boost your mood.

### Considering Socialization

This might seem counterintuitive, but if we're feeling really crummy, it might not be a good time to force socialization with others. Sometimes it's better to interact without investing in the "other." For instance, a visit to the market can put us in the presence of others and out in the world, without the pressure of deep communication.

### Reading

If you're an avid reader like me, allowing yourself to read can be a therapeutic activity, especially on a "slightly off my game day" when the weather is unpleasant. Choosing the right reading material is crucial, though!

## Conclusion

This was a slightly different post since the whole post was an activity. I hope you found it interesting and helpful. Do let me know.
