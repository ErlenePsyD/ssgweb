_Thoughts and Suggestions from an Aging Psychologist._

## Memories of Raindrops

Do you remember the childhood ditty "Rain, rain, go away? Come again another day. Little Sandy wants to play"? I wonder if we chanted it while jumping rope. Perhaps my mother sang it to me when I complained about the rain ruining my outdoor adventure.

> "When life throws you a rainy day, play in the puddles."

-- A.A. Milne, Winnie the Pooh

When I whined about the rain to my grandmother, she would stop whatever she was doing, look me straight in the eye, and firmly declare, "You are not made of spun sugar. Go outside. You will not melt in the rain." To this day, I credit my solid ego to her unwavering directness.

## Rain's Universal Influence

Rain is a fact of life. With the looming threat of climate change affecting everyone, everywhere, rain is an even more pressing topic of discussion. Regardless of whether it's perceived as a blessing or a curse, a desperate need or a threat to existence, rain's signficance permeates all societies.

## Wisdom from the Storms of the Past

The age-old advice "Save for a rainy day" urges us to be prepared for unexpected challenges. It warns that unpredictable hardships — just as inevitable as sunny or [crummy]({filename}the-crummy-day-toolkit.md), cloudy days — will certainly arise.

Winnie the Pooh, ever the optimist, counsels us to go out into the rain and "play in the puddles." Sometimes we just don't have the necessary gear to protect us from the rain, or courage to go out and play. Yet, between surrendering to the storm and playing in it blithely, we can discover a vast range of potential responses.

Equipped with even modest raingear and a pinch of courage, we can reassure ourselves: the rain is fleeting, the sun will return, and soon enough, we'll once again be able to splash in the puddles.

> "You're braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think."

-- Winnie the Pooh

## The Changing Tides of Age

As we age, we encounter evolving challenges: the fading of sensory sharpness, the diminishing of speed, strength, and vitality.

The loss of significant roles and relationships, some precious and intimate, often flood over us — far more than any "rain gear" could protect us from. These losses, while usual, are unpredictable.

## When we have a rainy day, we need our friends

Pooh relies on his best friend, Piglet, when the inevitable rain happens, whether this be raindrops or torrents.

> "If you have a little problem, I could try to lend a hand and if you're feeling sad, just tell me and I'll try to understand."

-- Piglet

Aging inevitably leads to the dwindling of our circle of companions, right when life's storms are frequent and sometimes even redefine our existence. It's during these times when we need a friend to be with us and try to understand.
