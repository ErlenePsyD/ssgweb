## Navigating the Parent-Child Dynamic in Later Life

"The Transitions of Aging: How Parents and Children Can Adjust" was written by the outstanding journalist and podcast host, Ashley Milne-Tyte. As a clinical psychologist who has specialized in aging issues for many years, I discussed certain realities of aging that have special impact on the relationship between older persons and their adult children as they each hold different expectations of what their role is.

For example, the adult child wants to keep their parents safe and healthy as much as possible and for as long as possible. The older person often is willing to take some small risks in order to maintain a semblance of agency over their life, at a stage when many changes are foisted upon them just from the experience of aging.

## Competence and the Right to Choose

Another point that also informs their relationship was the understanding and appreciation that if someone is competent to make decisions, they are competent to make decisions that we don't like or don't approve of.

Competent people are competent to make poor decisions.

This is a crucial distinction that adult children must grapple with as they navigate their evolving relationships with aging parents.

## The Power of Life Narratives

I also spoke of the role of stories, of one's life narrative, as being helpful in establishing and maintaining relationships, especially when the opportunity for new experiences and accomplishments are reduced or denied.

To be able to feel that you can say something and have something to offer is helpful. Even if it's repeated many times, it is worth being recalled and shared.

## Final Thoughts

I think it was a very good article written by a very good writer and definitely worth the read.
