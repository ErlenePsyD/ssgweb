_Thoughts and Suggestions from an Aging Psychologist._

## An Early Realization of Life's Impermanence

I'd like to share with you a story I call "Grandmother's Ironing Basket." As a little girl, I gradually became aware of my grandmother's old age. This realization brought me a sense of concern about her inevitable absence in my life. One day, she noticed my wistful expression and asked if something was bothering me. I confessed my thoughts about her aging and not always being around.

## Grandmother's Insightful Response

She paused, acknowledging the importance of her role in my life and vice versa. She listed her daily tasks, including cooking, baking, laundry, sewing, and ironing. As she spoke, I giggled, mentioning my love for her baked goods and the smell of steam from the ironing. She paused again, showing her deep understanding of a child's mind and the concept of mortality.

> "Keep your eye on my ironing basket; as long as there's ironing to be done, I'll be here."

This statement of reassurance became a symbol of her continued presence in my life.

## The Ever-Present Ironing Basket

Reflecting back, I never recall seeing her laundry basket empty. There was always something that needed ironing. As a clinical psychologist specializing in geropsychology, I wonder if this was not only for my reassurance but also for her sense of purpose and connection.

## A Personal Reflection

Initially, I frequently checked the basket, but over time, my attention shifted away. The story resurfaced in my mind amidst feelings of being overwhelmed by life's demands, especially during the transition from one year to another.

## The Burden of Daily Demands

I often feel overwhelmed by my "laundry basket" of To-Do items, particularly around the New Year. The pressure from various responsibilities, deadlines, and commitments is immense. Self-care often falls to the bottom of the list, along with concerns for inner peace, nutrition, creativity, and maintaining relationships.

### The Challenge of Balancing Life's Demands

- Inner Peace: The need for meditation.
- Nutrition: Shopping at multiple markets.
- Creativity: Finding time for activities like music classes.
- Relationships: Managing birthdays and necessary follow-ups.

## The Concept of 'Master Demands'

Often, our feelings of pressure stem from our internal dialogue. I have identified four 'Master Demands' that amplify this stress:

### Master Demands

1. SHOULD
2. OUGHT
3. HAVE-TO
4. MUST

## A New Year's Resolution for Change

As we approach 2024, I resolve to address these 'Master Demands.' I plan to describe their impact on our stress and frustration levels and suggest ways to reframe our thinking. This will help us find more connection, purpose, and meaning in our lives.
