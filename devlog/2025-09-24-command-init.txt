 Tips for getting started:

  Use Claude to help with file analysis, editing, bash commands and git
  Be as specific as you would with another engineer for the best results
  ✔ Run /init to create a CLAUDE.md file with instructions for Claude
  ✔ Run /terminal-setup to set up terminal integration

> /init is analyzing your codebase… 

⏺ I'll analyze the codebase and create a CLAUDE.md file with the essential information for future Claude Code
  instances.

⏺ Now I'll create the CLAUDE.md file based on this analysis:

     # CLAUDE.md
     This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.
     ## Project Overview
     This is ErlenePsyD.com, a psychology blog and professional website built with Pelican (Python static site
     generator). The site focuses on gerontology and clinical psychology content by Dr. Erlene Rosowsky.
     ## Development Commands
     … +69 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ I've created a comprehensive CLAUDE.md file that captures the essential information for future Claude Code
  instances working with this psychology website codebase. The file includes:

  Key sections:
  - Project overview and purpose
  - Essential development commands for Pelican
  - Content development patterns and syntax
  - Architecture details including plugins and configuration
  - Deployment workflow and branch strategy
  - Technical considerations for dependencies and builds

  Focus on practical information:
  - Commands needed for daily development
  - Content creation patterns with proper image syntax
  - Key configuration files and their purposes
  - Deployment automation understanding
  - Important architectural patterns that aren't obvious from single files

  The file avoids generic development advice and focuses on the specific patterns and workflows unique to this
  Pelican-based psychology website, referencing the existing comprehensive documentation in README.md and WORKFLOW.md
   without duplicating it.

> There's a Trello board with some information I'd like to retrieve and incorporate into our local documentation, 
  specifically @WORKFLOW.md -- is that something we can do easily with the Trello API?
  ⎿  Read WORKFLOW.md (205 lines)

⏺ Looking at the Trello API capabilities, yes, this is definitely doable! The Trello API provides comprehensive
  access to board data including cards, lists, descriptions, due dates, and more.

⏺ Web Search("Trello API authentication get board data cards lists 2025")
  ⎿  Did 1 search in 38s                                                                                            

⏺ Fetch(https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/trello/guides/rest-api/api-introduction/)
  ⎿  Received 290.8KB (200 OK)

⏺ Based on my research, yes, we can definitely retrieve information from your Trello board and incorporate it into
  WORKFLOW.md using the Trello API. Here's what's involved:

  Authentication Requirements

  - API Key: Generated by creating a Trello Power-Up (one-time setup)
  - API Token: User-specific token with configurable permissions
  - Both are required for all API requests

  Key API Endpoints for Your Use Case

  - GET /1/boards/{boardId}/cards - Get all cards from the board
  - GET /1/boards/{boardId}/lists - Get all lists from the board
  - GET /1/boards/{boardId}/cards?lists=open&cards=open - Get comprehensive board data

  What We Can Extract

  - Card titles, descriptions, due dates
  - List names and organization
  - Card assignments and labels
  - Comments and activity (if needed)
  - Board structure and workflow states

  Integration Options

  1. One-time sync: Fetch current Trello data and merge into WORKFLOW.md
  2. Scripted approach: Create a Python script using the requests library
  3. Manual JSON export: Add .json to your board URL for quick data access
                                                                                                     
⏺ User approved Claude's plan:
  ⎿  Plan: Integrate Trello Board Data into WORKFLOW.md

     Phase 1: Setup Trello API Access

     1. Help you generate Trello API key and token if needed
     2. Test API connectivity with your board

     Phase 2: Extract and Analyze Trello Data

     3. Fetch board structure (lists, cards, descriptions)
     4. Identify relevant workflow information to integrate
     5. Map Trello workflow states to current WORKFLOW.md structure

     Phase 3: Update WORKFLOW.md

     6. Merge Trello information into appropriate sections of WORKFLOW.md
     7. Preserve existing workflow while adding Trello-derived insights
     8. Ensure formatting consistency with current documentation

     Requirements from you:

     - Trello board URL or ID
     - Confirm what specific information you want extracted (tasks, workflow states, deadlines, etc.)
     - API credentials (I'll guide you through setup if needed)

⏺ Great! Let's start by setting up your Trello API access. I'll need a few pieces of information from you:

  Step 1: Get Your Trello API Credentials

  First, let's get your API Key:
  1. Go to https://trello.com/app-key
  2. You'll see your API Key at the top - copy that

  Next, generate a Token:
  1. On the same page, click the "Token" link
  2. This will take you to an authorization page
  3. Click "Allow" to generate your token
  4. Copy the token that's generated

  Finally, I need your Trello board information:
  - What's the URL of your Trello board? (e.g., https://trello.com/b/abc123/my-board)
  - Or if you prefer, just the board ID (the part after /b/ in the URL)

  Step 2: What Information Should We Extract?

  Looking at your current WORKFLOW.md, I can see it covers:
  - Environment setup steps
  - Content development process
  - Testing and PR workflows
  - Common commands and troubleshooting

  From your Trello board, what specific information would be most valuable to integrate? For example:
  - Task checklists or workflows
  - Project milestones or deadlines
  - Team processes or responsibilities
  - Content planning or editorial calendar

  Once you provide the API credentials and board details, I can fetch the data and show you what's available to
  integrate.
