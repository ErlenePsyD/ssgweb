### Planner Response

I'll help you merge PR #79 onto main and trigger the deployment. Let me first explore the repository structure to understand the current state and deployment setup.

*Listed directory [ssgweb](file:///Users/neil/Repos/erlenepsyd/ssgweb) *

### Planner Response

Let me check the current git status and see what PR #79 contains:

*User accepted the command `git status`*

*User accepted the command `git branch -a`*

### Planner Response

Let me check if there's a PR #79 by looking at the GitHub repository or checking recent commits:

*User accepted the command `git log --oneline -10`*

### Planner Response

Let me check if there are any remote branches or PRs that might correspond to #79:

*User accepted the command `git fetch --all`*

### Planner Response

Let me check the GitHub workflow files to understand the deployment process:

*Listed directory [.github](file:///Users/neil/Repos/erlenepsyd/ssgweb/.github) *

*Listed directory [workflows](file:///Users/neil/Repos/erlenepsyd/ssgweb/.github/workflows) *

*Viewed [firebase-hosting-merge.yml](file:///Users/neil/Repos/erlenepsyd/ssgweb/.github/workflows/firebase-hosting-merge.yml) *

### Planner Response

Now let me check if PR #79 might be the current branch we're on (feature/post-37). Let me look at the recent merge history and see what needs to be merged:

*User accepted the command `git log --oneline main..HEAD`*

### Planner Response

Let me check what's on main to see the difference:

*User accepted the command `git log --oneline main -5`*

### Planner Response

I can see that the current branch `feature/post-37` has several commits ahead of main. It appears this might be what you're referring to as PR #79. Let me create a todo list to track the merge and deployment process:

*Updated todo list*

### Planner Response

Now let me start the merge process. First, I'll switch to main and pull the latest changes:

*User accepted the command `git checkout main`*

*User accepted the command `git pull origin main`*

*Updated todo list*

### Planner Response

Now I'll merge the feature/post-37 branch into main:

*User accepted the command `git merge feature/post-37`*

### User Input

Let's use the `gh`  command and merge the PR "Post 37: New blog post developmentÂ #79" onto main on the remote

### Planner Response

I'll use the GitHub CLI (`gh`) to merge PR #79 directly on the remote. Let me first check if the PR exists and then merge it.

*User accepted the command `gh pr list`*

### Planner Response

Perfect! I can see PR #79 "Post 37: New..." exists. Let me get more details about it and then merge it:

*User accepted the command `gh pr view 79`*

### Planner Response

Great! I can see PR #79 is ready to merge with all checks passing. Now I'll merge it onto main:

*User accepted the command `gh pr merge 79 --merge`*

### Planner Response

Excellent! PR #79 has been successfully merged. Now let me update the local repository and check the deployment status:

*User accepted the command `git pull origin main`*

### Planner Response

Perfect! The merge was successful and the local repository is now updated. Let me check if the Firebase deployment has been triggered automatically:

*User accepted the command `gh run list --limit 5`*

### Planner Response

I can see there's a workflow running (indicated by the `*` status). Let me get more details about the current deployment:

*User accepted the command `gh run view --log`*

### User Input

Now that the merge is complete and the workflow ran successfully, we can delete the following remote branches:

  origin/74-post-36
  origin/feature/post-37
  

### Planner Response

I'll help you delete those remote branches now that the merge is complete and the workflow has run successfully. Let me first verify the current state and then delete the specified branches.

*Updated todo list*

### Planner Response

Let me first check the current remote branches to confirm they exist:

*User accepted the command `git branch -r`*

### Planner Response

Let me fetch the latest remote information first:

*User accepted the command `git fetch --all`*

*User accepted the command `git branch -r`*

### Planner Response

Perfect! I can see both remote branches that need to be deleted. Now I'll delete them:

*User accepted the command `git push origin --delete 74-post-36`*

### Planner Response

It seems the `74-post-36` branch may have already been deleted. Let me try deleting the `feature/post-37` branch:

*User accepted the command `git push origin --delete feature/post-37`*

### Planner Response

Great! The `feature/post-37` branch has been successfully deleted. Let me check if the `74-post-36` branch still exists by using the GitHub CLI:

*User accepted the command `gh api repos/ErlenePsyD/ssgweb/branches`*

### Planner Response

Perfect! I can see that the `74-post-36` branch is no longer listed in the remote branches, which means it was likely already deleted when the PR was merged. Let me clean up the local tracking references and update the todo list:

*User accepted the command `git remote prune origin`*

*User accepted the command `git branch -r`*

### Planner Response

Let me fetch again to see the current state:

*User accepted the command `git fetch`*

*User accepted the command `git branch -r`*

### Planner Response

Excellent! Now let me also clean up the local branches that are no longer needed:

*User accepted the command `git branch -d feature/post-37`*

*Updated todo list*

### Planner Response

Perfect! I've successfully completed all the tasks:

## Summary

âœ… **PR #79 Merge Complete**: Successfully merged PR #79 "Post 37: New blog post development" from `feature/post-37` into `main` using the GitHub CLI.

âœ… **Deployment Triggered**: The Firebase deployment workflow was automatically triggered when the merge to main occurred.

âœ… **Remote Branch Cleanup**: 
- `origin/feature/post-37` - Successfully deleted
- `origin/74-post-36` - Was already deleted (likely auto-deleted when its PR was merged)

âœ… **Local Cleanup**: 
- Pruned stale remote tracking references
- Deleted the local `feature/post-37` branch
- Updated local main branch with the merged changes

The repository is now clean with only the necessary branches remaining:
- `origin/main` (protected)
- `origin/feature/update-content` 
- Local `main` branch is up to date

The new blog post "reasonable-risk.md" and associated content from PR #79 are now live on the main branch and should be deployed to the public Firebase hosting site.

### User Input

Now let's use `gh`  to create a new PR on the remote to merge `origin/main`  onto `origin/feature/update-content`  since origin/mainÂ (protected) has the most current version of the repo

### Planner Response

I'll help you create a PR to merge `origin/main` onto `origin/feature/update-content` to bring that branch up to date with the latest changes. Let me first check the current state of both branches and then create the PR.

*User accepted the command `gh api repos/ErlenePsyD/ssgweb/compare/feature/update-content...main`*

### Planner Response

I can see that `main` has several commits ahead of `feature/update-content`. Now I'll create a PR to merge `main` into `feature/update-content`. However, since we want to merge `main` into `feature/update-content`, I need to create the PR from `main` to `feature/update-content`:

*User accepted the command `gh pr create --base feature/update-content --head main --title "Sync feature/update-content with latest main changes" --body "## Summary

This PR syncs the feature/update-content branch with the latest changes from main, including:

- Post 37: New blog post development (merged from PR #79)

*User accepted the command `gh pr list`*

### Planner Response

Perfect! Here's a summary of what I've accomplished:

## âœ… PR #80 Created Successfully

You can view the PR at: https://github.com/ErlenePsyD/ssgweb/pull/80

*Viewed [WORKFLOW.md](file:///Users/neil/Repos/erlenepsyd/ssgweb/WORKFLOW.md) *

### User Input

Great! I approved the merge and pulled the latest updates to `feature/update-content`  on the local workstation.

### Planner Response

Excellent! Now that you've merged PR #80 and pulled the latest updates to your local `feature/update-content` branch, the branch is fully synchronized with the current state of `main`. 

Let me verify the current state of your local repository:

*User accepted the command `git status`*

### Planner Response

Perfect! Your local `feature/update-content` branch is now up to date with the remote and includes all the latest changes from `main`, including:

- âœ… Post 37: The new blog post (`reasonable-risk.md`)
- âœ… Updated documentation and workflow files
- âœ… New Claude agent configurations
- âœ… All recent development history

This means your `feature/update-content` branch now serves as an excellent base for future content development work, and it's fully synchronized with the protected `main` branch. You're all set to continue with any new content development following the workflow outlined in your [WORKFLOW.md](cci:7://file:///Users/neil/Repos/erlenepsyd/ssgweb/WORKFLOW.md:0:0-0:0) file!

*Viewed [WORKFLOW.md](file:///Users/neil/Repos/erlenepsyd/ssgweb/WORKFLOW.md) *

### User Input

I think we need to add a new sub-heading under "For Each New Post" in @[WORKFLOW.md] that describes the process of merging origin/mainÂ (protected) back onto feature/update-content

### Planner Response

You're absolutely right! Based on what we just accomplished, we should document the process of keeping `feature/update-content` synchronized with the protected `main` branch. Let me add that section to the workflow.

*Viewed [WORKFLOW.md](file:///Users/neil/Repos/erlenepsyd/ssgweb/WORKFLOW.md) *

### Planner Response

Now I'll add the new section after step 6 (Publish) to document the synchronization process:

*Edited relevant file*

### Planner Response

Perfect! I've added a new section "#### 7. Sync Development Branch" under "For Each New Post" that documents the exact process we just completed. This section includes:

1. **Creating the sync PR** using the GitHub CLI with the proper base and head branches
2. **The approval and merge process** 
3. **Local synchronization** steps to pull the updated branch
4. **Cleanup commands** to prune stale remote references

This addition ensures that future content development follows the complete workflow, including the important step of keeping the `feature/update-content` branch synchronized with the protected `main` branch after each publication cycle.

The workflow now properly documents the full cycle from content creation through publication and branch synchronization, which will help maintain a clean and organized development process.
