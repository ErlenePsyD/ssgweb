# Thoughts and Suggestions from an Aging Psychologist

## Focus on Nostalgia

> "Tis the season to be... wistful, reflective, awash in memories of youth, family, celebrations, relationships, dinners, things that happened, people gone, connections, silly things, visits, special foods..."

As I age, looking back and reviewing a life lived becomes increasingly precious. The holiday season provides an ideal backdrop for such reflections. Nostalgia, it seems, is a constant companion.

### The Image of Nostalgia

Imagine an old person, rocking slowly in a chair on a porch, lost in thought. They might be smiling or shedding a few tears as they recall their past. What appears as idleness is actually a dynamic, purposeful activity.

#### Nostalgia: A Yearning for the Past

In our later years, nostalgia reminds us of our former selves. It helps us piece together our life's experiences, shaping who we are today. We remain fundamentally the same person, sculpted and refined by life's journey.

### Nostalgia's Universal Appeal

It's common in older age to reminisce and review. Certain experiences become emblematic, representing freedom, joy, beauty, health, and strength â€” qualities often felt as diminished in later years.

#### Nostalgia's Triggers

Nostalgia can be prompted by various cues:

- A book we're reading
- A cartoon in the newspaper
- Music, food, or social activities
- Family interactions, especially during holidays

We begin nostalgically but can guide these thoughts deliberately. This understanding is crucial in cognitive therapies, showing we're not captive to our reminiscences.

### Nostalgia's Dual Purpose

Nostalgia isn't just for the individual; it serves a generative purpose as well. Grandparents often share stories with their grandchildren, highlighting their past resilience. Such stories serve two purposes:

1. For the older adult, they reinforce their identity continuity despite physical changes.
2. For the younger listeners, they offer lessons of courage and perseverance.

> "Though I can no longer do that, I have met and coped with many other challenges along the way and lived to tell the tale!"

## Reflective Activity

1. **Favorite Holiday Memories:** What are some of your cherished holiday memories?
2. **Recognizing Toxic Memories:** Can you identify a toxic memory as it begins? Do you know how to halt it?
3. **Humorous Recollections:** Can you recall a funny holiday memory? (Many begin in the kitchen.)

In conclusion, I wish you joy, delicious moments, and beauty this season.
