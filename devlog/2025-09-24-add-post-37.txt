 Tips for getting started:

  Run /init to create a CLAUDE.md file with instructions for Claude
  Use Claude to help with file analysis, editing, bash commands and git
  Be as specific as you would with another engineer for the best results
  ✔ Run /terminal-setup to set up terminal integration

> /clear 
  ⎿  (no content)

> /agents 
  ⎿  Agent changes:
     Created agent: blog-post-editor

> Use the @agent-blog-post-editor to edit @drafts/post_37.txt and create a new, edited markdown file
  ⎿  Read ../drafts/post_37.txt (61 lines)

⏺ I'll use the blog-post-editor agent to format and edit the draft blog post for web publication.

⏺ blog-post-editor(Format blog post draft)
  ⎿  Done (2 tool uses · 14.8k tokens · 41.5s)                                                                      

⏺ The blog-post-editor agent has successfully formatted your draft into a web-ready markdown file at
  /Users/neil/Repos/erlenepsyd/ssgweb/drafts/reasonable-risk.md. The agent improved structure, readability, and
  formatting while preserving all your original clinical insights and authentic voice.

> Great! I've moved the file to @erlenepsyd.com/content/blog/reasonable-risk.md and added the accompanying 
  @erlenepsyd.com/content/images/alpine-river-granite-peaks.jpg -- let's generate the site locally!
  ⎿  Read content/blog/reasonable-risk.md (128 lines)
  ⎿  Read content/images/alpine-river-granite-peaks.jpg (378KB)

⏺ Perfect! Let's generate the site locally to see how the newly published blog post looks. I'll run the Pelican build
   and start the development server.

⏺ Bash(cd erlenepsyd.com && poetry run pelican --listen --autoreload)
  ⎿  Interrupted · What should Claude do instead?

> I think you need to run `pelican content/` first.

⏺ You're absolutely right! Let me first generate the site, then start the development server.

⏺ Bash(cd erlenepsyd.com && poetry run pelican content/)
  ⎿  Error: The currently activated Python version 3.11.4 is not supported by the project (^3.12,<3.13).
     Trying to find and use a compatible version.

     The `python3.12' command exists in these Python versions:
       3.12.3

     Note: See 'pyenv help global' for tips on allowing both
           python2 and python3 to be found.

     … +1 line (ctrl+o to see all)

⏺ Let me try using the system's Python directly instead of Poetry:

⏺ Bash(cd erlenepsyd.com && python -m pelican content/)
  ⎿  Error: /Users/neil/.pyenv/versions/3.11.4/bin/python: No module named pelican

⏺ Let me check what Python version is available and install the dependencies:

⏺ Bash(cd erlenepsyd.com && python3 --version && pip3 install -r requirements.txt)
  ⎿  Interrupted · What should Claude do instead?

> Let's use the existing `poetry` infrastructure for dependency management please

⏺ You're right! Let me use the existing Poetry setup. Let me first activate the Poetry shell and then generate the
  site:

⏺ Bash(cd erlenepsyd.com && poetry shell && poetry run pelican content/)
  ⎿  Interrupted · What should Claude do instead?

> Please refer to the Prerequistes section in @README.md for details on how to set up poetry and executing local 
  commands.
  ⎿  Read ../README.md (382 lines)

⏺ Looking at the Prerequisites section in the README, I can see the proper workflow. Let me follow the documented
  steps:

⏺ Bash(poetry install)
  ⎿  Error: The currently activated Python version 3.11.4 is not supported by the project (^3.12,<3.13).
     Trying to find and use a compatible version. 
     pyenv: python3.12: command not found

     The `python3.12' command exists in these Python versions:
       3.12.3

     Note: See 'pyenv help global' for tips on allowing both
           python2 and python3 to be found.

     … +1 line (ctrl+o to see all)

⏺ I need to set the correct Python version first. Let me switch to Python 3.12.3:

⏺ Bash(pyenv local 3.12.3 && poetry install)
  ⎿  Installing dependencies from lock file

⏺ Great! Now let's navigate to the erlenepsyd.com directory and generate the site:

⏺ Bash(cd erlenepsyd.com && poetry run pelican content/)
  ⎿ Done: Processed 38 articles, 0 drafts, 0 hidden articles, 4 pages, 0 hidden

    … +14 lines (ctrl+o to expand)


⏺ Perfect! The site was generated successfully (processed 38 articles including our new one). Now let's start the
  local development server:

⏺ Bash(cd erlenepsyd.com && poetry run pelican --listen --autoreload)
  ⎿  Running in the background (down arrow to manage)

⏺ BashOutput(Reading shell output)
  ⎿  (eval):cd:1: no such file or directory: erlenepsyd.com

⏺ Let me run the command from the correct directory:

⏺ Bash(poetry run pelican --listen --autoreload)
  ⎿  Running in the background (down arrow to manage)

⏺ BashOutput(Reading shell output)
  ⎿    --- AutoReload Mode: Monitoring `content`, `theme` and `settings` for changes.
     ---
     Serving site at: http://127.0.0.1:8000 - Tap CTRL-C to stop
     … +2 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Perfect! The local development server is now running. The site is available at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

  The server successfully processed 38 articles (including your new "reasonable-risk" blog post) and is running in
  auto-reload mode, so any changes you make to content will automatically regenerate the site.

  You can now visit http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your browser to see:
  - Your new blog post on the homepage
  - The alpine river image displaying correctly
  - All the formatted content with proper headings, quotes, and structure

  When you're done reviewing the site, you can press CTRL-C in the terminal to stop the server.

> The Date in the content file was incorrect (2024 instead of 2025) so we need to regenerate the site so it appears 
  correctly.

⏺ You're right! Since you corrected the date from 2024 to 2025, the site should automatically regenerate with the
  auto-reload server. Let me check the server output to confirm it detected the change:

⏺ BashOutput(Reading shell output)
  ⎿    --- AutoReload Mode: Monitoring `content`, `theme` and `settings` for changes.
     ---
     Serving site at: http://127.0.0.1:8000 - Tap CTRL-C to stop
     … +2 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Let me check for more recent output:

⏺ BashOutput(Reading shell output)
  ⎿    --- AutoReload Mode: Monitoring `content`, `theme` and `settings` for changes.
     ---
     Serving site at: http://127.0.0.1:8000 - Tap CTRL-C to stop
     … +2 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ It seems the auto-reload might not have triggered yet. Let me manually regenerate the site to ensure the date
  change is reflected:

⏺ Bash(cd erlenepsyd.com && poetry run pelican content/)
  ⎿  Error: (eval):cd:1: no such file or directory: erlenepsyd.com

⏺ Bash(poetry run pelican /Users/neil/Repos/erlenepsyd/ssgweb/erlenepsyd.com/content/)
  ⎿  Done: Processed 38 articles, 0 drafts, 0 hidden articles, 4 pages, 0 hidden
     pages and 0 draft pages in 0.88 seconds.

⏺ Perfect! The site has been regenerated successfully with the corrected date (2025-09-24 14:00). The auto-reload
  server should now be serving the updated version at http://127.0.0.1:8000 with the proper date displayed.

> I'd like to insert a link to @erlenepsyd.com/content/blog/aging-truths.md in the first paragraph. Please generate the
   link format so Pelican can interpret it correctly.

⏺ Looking at the aging-truths.md file, I can see it has the slug "aging-truths" and was published in 2024. For
  Pelican to correctly link to this post, you should use this format:

  [aging truths]({filename}/blog/aging-truths.md)

  So in your first paragraph of reasonable-risk.md, you would update this sentence:

  In my last post, I wrote about the internalized script...

  to:

  In my [last post]({filename}/blog/aging-truths.md), I wrote about the internalized script...

  The {filename} syntax tells Pelican to generate the correct URL for the referenced article, ensuring the link works
   properly in both development and production environments.

> Unfortunately, autoreload doesn't seem to be working, so let's regenerate the site

⏺ You're right, let me manually regenerate the site to pick up your link addition:

⏺ Bash(poetry run pelican /Users/neil/Repos/erlenepsyd/ssgweb/erlenepsyd.com/content/)
  ⎿  Done: Processed 38 articles, 0 drafts, 0 hidden articles, 4 pages, 0 hidden
     pages and 0 draft pages in 0.86 seconds.

⏺ Perfect! The site has been regenerated and now includes the link to your aging-truths post. The link should now be
  working properly in your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000, connecting the two related posts about aging and
  intergenerational dynamics.

> That's some fine work on your part! I committed and pushed the site, and now I'm going to check to see if the site 
  deployed correctly to the staging site.

⏺ Excellent work! Since you've committed and pushed the changes, the GitHub Actions should have automatically
  triggered a staging deployment. You can check the deployment status and get the staging URL a few ways:

  1. Check GitHub Actions status:
  gh run list
  2. View the most recent run details:
  gh run view --web
  3. The staging URL should also be posted as a comment on your PR once the deployment completes.

  The staging site will let you verify that:
  - The new blog post appears correctly
  - The link to the aging-truths post works properly
  - The alpine river image displays with the correct responsive formatting
  - The corrected 2025 date shows up

  Once you confirm everything looks good on staging, you'll be ready to merge to main for the production deployment!

> A successful deployment! I've sent the URL to the client for review.

⏺ Perfect! That's excellent news that the deployment was successful. The client now has the staging URL to review the
   new blog post with all the formatting improvements, proper internal linking, and the beautiful alpine river image.

  Since the local development server is still running, you can stop it now if you'd like:

⏺ Kill Shell(Kill shell: 231f0d)
  ⎿  Shell 231f0d killed

⏺ Great! The local development server has been stopped. The blog-post-editor agent did excellent work transforming
  the raw draft into a polished, web-ready article that maintains the clinical insights while making it much more
  readable online.

  Once you get the client's feedback and any requested changes, you'll be all set to merge to main for the production
   deployment!
