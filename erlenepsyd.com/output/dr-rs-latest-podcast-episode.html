<p>I'm delighted to share a <a href="https://livingto100.club/2022/06/13/personality-disorders-in-older-adults-insights-from-a-subject-matter-expert/">link to a recent podcast I did on the topic of Personality Disorders on Old Age</a>, a major area of my research.</p>
<p>I appeared at the invitation of Dr. Joe Casciani, who hosts one of the best-rated podcasts addressing older age, the <a href="https://www.livingto100.club"><em>Living to 100 Club</em></a>.</p>
<h2>Topics we covered</h2>
<p><img alt="Living to 100 Club: a podcast about turing aging on its head" class="image-process-article-image right" src="/images/derivatives/article-image/living_to_100_club.png"/></p>
<p>We begin the interview with a discussion of how I became interested in geropsychology, as that was not my original academic major. I discovered that I especially loved the stories, the narratives, of the older patients with whom I was working.</p>
<p>Then, we discussed how I came to focus on those older adults who were difficult; who all through life have had a tough time in work and relationships, never getting their needs met, and repeating the same struggles over and over.</p>
<p>I became curious: what were they like, what were their lives like, when called upon to face the challenges of older age?</p>
<p>I discovered that the professional literature was slim, and existing theories didn't encourage exploration. The diagnoses of character pathology, ultimately personality disorders, were an apparent dead end.</p>
<p>According to the theories of the time, these people were just who they were, with limited capacity for change -- all told, an area rife for a newly minted professional to explore.</p>
<p>And so, I launched my academic focus on Personality Disorders in Old Age.</p>
<p>Dr. Casciani and I then covered how personality disorders did not end with the person alone. Rather the "disorder" was experienced quite profoundly by those with whom they were in close relationships: their family, friends, colleagues and caregivers.</p>
<p>He also asked about what works best when we interact with difficult personalities. I shared some insights and suggestions from my clinical experience -- for example, with individuals who are chronically suspicious, angry, impulsive, or exceptionally self-important.</p>
