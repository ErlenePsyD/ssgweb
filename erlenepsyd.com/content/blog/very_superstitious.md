_Thoughts and Suggestions from an Aging Psychologist._

## The Mystery of Superstitions

I believe that all of us embrace superstitions, though some more than others. Most of our superstitions likely originated during our childhood. Our relationship with these superstitions is complex, and we might not always consider their impact.

> "I don't actually know why, but it's just what we did in our family."

We may feel hesitant about admitting our superstitions. What would we call our engagement with them? Do we subscribe to a superstition? Or simply follow one? Most might respond with, "I never thought about it," or perhaps say, "Better to be safe than sorry," accompanied by a sheepish grin. Could there be some truth to these superstitions?

## The Evolution and Significance of Superstitions

Superstitions are an amalgamation of suggestions, prescriptions, warnings, and mandates inherited from our cultures and families. Some get lost with time, others evolve, and new ones emerge. Today, many relate to modern technology. We jokingly blame mischievous gremlins for computer glitches and might even adopt routines to keep these fictional pests at bay.

Yet, traditional superstitions persist:

- Crossing our fingers
- Avoiding cracks on the sidewalk
- Steering clear of broken mirrors
- Bypassing ladders instead of walking underneath them
- Dodging black cats
- Refraining from booking a room on the 13th floor
- Throwing salt over our shoulder
- Knocking on wood, sometimes searching just to find real wood

Superstitions aren't meaningless. When they dominate our lives in terms of power, frequency, and control, they could indicate a mental health concern. Mostly, they grant us a fleeting sense of control without truly defying reality. However, ignoring them can sometimes make us uneasy, as cultural and individual reinforcements urge us to adhere.

> Observe what happens if someone in your group sneezes, and no one responds with a quick 'gesundheit' or 'God bless you.'

Many superstitions have roots in religious or occult beliefs. Tales of heavens, hells, devils, and evil eyes have been woven into these beliefs over time. Consider the ladder superstition—perhaps an unfortunate event did occur to someone walking under a ladder, leading to a cautionary tale advising others to walk around it.

Various cultures have adopted many of the same superstitions, though with slight variations. All promise a semblance of control: by adhering to or avoiding specific actions, like tossing salt or sidestepping sidewalk cracks, we might deter misfortune.

## The Dangers of Joy?

Some superstitions even caution us against joy, warning that happiness could herald impending doom. One common belief advises not laughing before breakfast, lest you end up crying by dinner. Experiencing intense joy early in the day is seen as a risky act, tempting fate.

Another superstition cautions against whistling or humming in cemeteries, suggesting these joyful acts might attract evil spirits. This is unfortunate since cemeteries often serve as serene spaces for reflection. But the fear of invoking malevolent entities looms large.

Such beliefs underscore our awareness of life's impermanence and uncertainties, central themes in our superstitions and anxieties. Even when we recognize the absurdity of a superstition, we often indulge in it. Why? Because "it's better to be safe than sorry."

## Journal Activity: Unraveling Superstitions

1. **List your superstitions.** Use examples from this article if needed.
2. Determine when each superstition began in your life.
3. Describe the perceived benefit of each superstition.
4. Recall any family superstitions you chose not to follow.
5. Remember instances where you defied a superstition. How did it feel?

## Embracing Liberation

Reflecting on superstitions may seem trivial. After all, hotel rooms are available on other floors besides the 13th.

However, the crux of the matter lies in our quest—especially as we age—for freedom from stifling conventions and automatic reactions. These unexamined habits bind and limit us.

> It is always good to find joy wherever we can find it.

It's liberating to shed these chains, to enjoy nature's beauty, to hum and whistle as we please, and to greet each day with joy.
