  I was   pleased to have been invited to be the featured contributor to a recent  article in the  National Public Radio (NPR)   Special Series “Living Better”, Aug. 21, 2025.

     “The transitions of aging: How Parents and Children Can Adjust, “was written by the outstanding journalist and podcast host, Ashley Milne-Tyte.  As a clinical psychologist who  has specialized in aging issues for many years, I  discussed  certain realities of aging that have special impact on the relationship between  older persons and their adult children as they each hold different expectations of what their role is.  For example, the adult child wants to keep their parents safe and healthy as much as possible and for as long as possible. The    older person often is willing to take some small risks in order to maintain a semblance of agency over their life, at a stage when    many changes are foisted upon them just from the experience of aging. Another point that also informs their relationship was the understanding and appreciation that if someone is competent to make decisions, they  are competentto  make decisions that we don't like or don't approve of. Competent people are competent  to make poor decisions.    

   I  also spoke of the role of stories, of one’s life’s narrative, as being  helpful  in establishing and maintaining   relationships ,especially when the opportunity for new experiences and accomplishments are reduced  or denied. To be able to feel that you can say something and have something to offer  is   helpful. Even if it's repeated many times, it is    worth being  recalled and shared.  

  I think it was a very good article written by a very good writer and definitely worth the read.ER
