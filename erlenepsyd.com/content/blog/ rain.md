_Thoughts and Suggestions from an Aging Psychologist._

## Raindrops of Memory

Do you remember the childhood ditty "Rain, rain, go away? Come again another day. Little Sandy wants to play"? I wonder if we chanted it while jumping rope. Perhaps my mother sang it to me when I complained about the rain ruining my outdoor adventure. Indeed, the ditty had its tune.

> "When life throws you a rainy day, play in the puddles."

-- A.A. Milne, Winnie the Pooh

When I expressed disappointment about the rain to my grandmother, she would pause her tasks, gaze directly at me, and assert, "You are not made of spun sugar. Go outside. You will not melt in the rain." To this day, I credit my solid ego to her unwavering directness.

## Rain's Universal Influence

Rain is a fact of life. With the looming threat of climate change affecting everyone, everywhere, rain has become an even more prevalent topic of discussion. Regardless of whether it's perceived as a blessing or a menace, a desperate need or a threat to existence, its influence permeates all societies. Yet, as a global community, we've struggled to agree on the reality of climate change, let alone unite to address it.

## Wisdom of the Ages

The age-old advice "Save for a rainy day" urges us to be prepared for unexpected challenges. It warns that unpredictable hardships—just as inevitable as sunny or cloudy days—will certainly arise.

Winnie the Pooh, ever the beacon of positivity, counsels us to embrace life's rain and "play in the puddles." At times, we might lack the tools or bravery to confront the rain. Yet, between surrendering to the storm and carefreely enjoying it exists a vast array of potential responses. Equipped with even basic protection and a pinch of courage, we can reassure ourselves: the rain is fleeting, the sun will return, and eventually, we'll once again delight in the puddles.

> "You're braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think."

-- Winnie the Pooh

## The Changing Tides of Age

As we mature, we encounter evolving challenges. The fading of sensory sharpness, the diminishing of speed, strength, and vitality are evident. The loss of significant roles and relationships, some deeply cherished, often hit us hard—far more than any "rain gear" could shield.

In times of turbulence, Winnie the Pooh finds solace in the companionship of his trusted ally, Piglet.

> "If you have a little problem, I could try to lend a hand and if you're feeling sad, just tell me and I'll try to understand."

-- Piglet

Aging inevitably leads to the dwindling of our circle of companions, right when life's storms frequent and sometimes even redefine our existence. It's during these periods that we most yearn for a companion—primarily to stand by us and empathize.
