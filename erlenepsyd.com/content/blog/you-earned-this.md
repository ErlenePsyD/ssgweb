## A Conversation About What Matters

I was delighted to be invited to join the "You Earned This" podcast. The conversation turned out to be one of those rare interviews where the questions themselves became catalysts for deeper reflection—the kind that stays with you long after the recording ends.

## What We Discussed

During our conversation, we explored some themes that are central to my teaching and research:

- The narratives we internalize about aging
- The role of humor in resilience
- The insidious nature of ageism
- The possibilities for meaningful connection in later life

These aren't abstract concepts. They emerge from real conversations with real people who are grappling with what it means to grow older in a society that often marginalizes its elders.

## An Invitation to Reflect

I invite you to listen with curiosity. Perhaps you'll recognize some of your own internalized scripts about aging. Perhaps you'll hear echoes of conversations you've had—or avoided—with aging parents or loved ones.

My hope is that this discussion offers not just information, but an opportunity for reflection.

What story are you telling yourself about growing old? And more importantly, is it a story that serves you?
