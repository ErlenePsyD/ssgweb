> Let's create a PR to merge the `feature/update-content` branch onto `feature/post-37` and then make `feature/post-37`
   our active branch.

⏺ I'll help you create a PR to merge feature/update-content into feature/post-37 and then switch to that branch. Let
  me break this down into steps:

⏺ Let me start by checking the current branch status and available branches:

⏺ Bash(git branch -a)
  ⎿    74-post-36                 
       feature/post-37
     * feature/update-content
     … +6 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Bash(git status)
  ⎿  On branch feature/update-content                               
     Your branch is up to date with 'origin/feature/update-content'.

     nothing to commit, working tree clean

⏺ Great! I can see that both branches exist locally and remotely. Now let me create the PR to merge
  feature/update-content into feature/post-37:

⏺ Bash(gh pr create --base feature/post-37 --head feature/update-content --title "Merge content updates into post-37
      branch" --body "## Summary
      - Merge recent content…)
  ⎿  https://github.com/ErlenePsyD/ssgweb/pull/78

⏺ Perfect! The PR has been created successfully. Now let me switch to the feature/post-37 branch:

⏺ Bash(git checkout feature/post-37)
  ⎿  Your branch is up to date with 'origin/feature/post-37'.
     Switched to branch 'feature/post-37'

⏺ Perfect! I've successfully:

  1. ✅ Created PR #78 to merge feature/update-content into feature/post-37:
  https://github.com/ErlenePsyD/ssgweb/pull/78
  2. ✅ Switched to the feature/post-37 branch as your active branch

  You're now on the feature/post-37 branch and ready to work. The PR is available for review and merging when you're
  ready.

> /export 
  ⎿  Export cancelled

> Let's clean up the local branches. The branch `74 post 36` has been deleted and is no longer needed

⏺ I'll help you clean up the local branch 74-post-36 since it's no longer needed.

⏺ Bash(git branch -d 74-post-36)
  ⎿  Deleted branch 74-post-36 (was 4fb9db2).

⏺ The local branch 74-post-36 has been successfully deleted. The branch is cleaned up and no longer taking up space
  in your local repository.

> Let's create a PR for `feature/post-37` so our pushes will deploy to Firebase

⏺ I'll create a PR for the feature/post-37 branch to enable Firebase deployment for your pushes.

⏺ Bash(gh pr create --title "Post 37: New blog post development" --body "## Summary
      - Development branch for new blog post (Post 37)…)
  ⎿  https://github.com/ErlenePsyD/ssgweb/pull/79

⏺ Perfect! I've created PR #79 for the feature/post-37 branch: https://github.com/ErlenePsyD/ssgweb/pull/79

  Now your pushes to the feature/post-37 branch will automatically trigger Firebase staging deployments, and you'll
  get preview URLs in the PR comments for testing your changes.
